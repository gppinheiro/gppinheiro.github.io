### Post2Pod (Completed)
Post2Pod was designed to solve the common pain of information overload for busy professionals and lifelong learners - transforming news articles, blog posts, newsletters, and even LinkedIn posts into podcast episodes.

**Status:** Discontinued due to low user adoption, but valuable learning experience in customer-driven product development.
