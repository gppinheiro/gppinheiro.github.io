                    before deeply validating the problem. As a Business Innovation master's graduate, the approach would
                    now be different: focusing first on in-depth discovery, interviewing users, experimenting with
                    prototypes, and letting the market signal its strongest needs before building and selling. This
                    iterative, customer-driven model would have surfaced real pain points early, informed commercial
                    strategy, and improved user acquisition.</custom-typography>
