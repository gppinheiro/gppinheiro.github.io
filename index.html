            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">The project began with a strong desire to dive deeper into various tech stacks and explore existing software engineering patterns. Alongside this, my enduring love for data and creating algorithms that can truly make a difference fueled my motivation. A key personal goal has been to generate a passive income that surpasses my monthly earnings. Combining these three ambitions, I embarked on developing a Stock Picking Algorithm.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">The journey was not without its challenges. Initially, I was faced with identifying the most suitable tech stack. Just two months ago, I decided to undertake a major refactor, segmenting the algorithm into four distinct systems:</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">🚦 Stock Analysis System: Leveraging principles from Value/Fundamental Investing and basic technical analysis inspired by various books and articles.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">💡 Recommendation Engine: Utilizing my database to suggest which stocks to buy or monitor.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">📊 Economic Factors Monitor: Keeping track of critical economic indicators.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">🔐 Identity Service: Implementing a security layer for my services API's.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">It is important to note that this algorithm currently operates automatically for US stocks only. I source data freely from the SEC and other APIs, with economic indicators being retrieved from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Remarkably, the system has been running for a year now, and I have managed to keep the total cost at ZERO euros. The portfolio's average profitability stands at around 18%, despite some initial missteps in stock selection. Today, I have much greater confidence in the algorithm's capabilities.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Some might wonder, why not simply invest in an S&P 500 fund? For me, the answer is clear: I wanted to learn how the great minds picked the best stocks in the past.</custom-typography>

            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">For the stock analysis algorithm, I only analyse financial data of US-listed companies. My goal is to continue having zero costs while ensuring data quality. Here's a brief overview of my approach and the tools I use.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">🇺🇸 Why US Public Companies?</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">US public companies must disclose their financial statements publicly, providing a wealth of free, high-quality data. This makes the US market an ideal starting point for algorithm development.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">💾 Data Sources and APIs</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">SEC API: The Securities and Exchange Commission offers a reliable API to access a wide range of financial statements and filings of public companies. It is the cornerstone of my data strategy.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">BEA API: The Bureau of Economic Analysis API provides valuable economic data, complementing the financial data from the SEC.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Other APIs: I've also tested APIs like Alpha Spread, FRED, and unofficial Yahoo Finance APIs. However, these sources often have confusing data structures, requiring additional processing.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">🔴 Challenges and Considerations</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Data Consistency: Ensuring data from different sources is consistent and high-quality is challenging.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Cost Management: By using publicly available data, I have none costs.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">API Limitations: Navigating rate limits and other constraints of each API is crucial for smooth data acquisition.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">🌫 Future Directions</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">I plan to expand the algorithm's scope to include companies outside the US, identifying new data sources while maintaining a cost-effective approach. My next steps on this matter is to get data as reported. Data that was not processed by others.</custom-typography>

            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Navigating the world of data storage has been quite the adventure for me! Here's a glimpse into my journey and the lessons I've learned along the way:</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">🌟 AWS Free Tier & PostgreSQL</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">I started my journey using AWS's free tier with PostgreSQL. It seemed like a perfect start until I discovered that AWS enabled diagnostics by default, which led to unexpected monthly charges. This experience taught me the importance of thoroughly understanding the cost implications of cloud services.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">🔧 Building a Raspberry Pi Server with MariaDB</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Determined to find a cost-effective solution, I decided to build my own server using a Raspberry Pi and MariaDB. This DIY approach was a fantastic learning experience, and I enjoyed the hands-on work. However, maintaining the server became increasingly time-consuming and tedious over the course of a year.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">🧑‍💻 Transition to Oracle with PL SQL</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Eventually, I transitioned to using Oracle with PL SQL. This shift came with its own set of challenges, primarily adapting my queries and algorithms to fit a new database system. However, it also provided a robust and reliable solution that required less day-to-day maintenance.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">🎓 Lessons Learned</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Cost Awareness: Always investigate the potential hidden costs of cloud services.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Hands-on Experience: Building and maintaining your own server is invaluable for learning but can be labor-intensive.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Flexibility: Be prepared to adapt and rewrite your queries and algorithms when switching databases.</custom-typography>
            <custom-typography slot="project-description" type="label">Reliability: Sometimes, investing in a more robust, albeit complex, solution pays off in the long run.</custom-typography>
